# Proposal

Provide a complete framework for deploying DataDog dashboards from a configuration file using a CI/CD pipeline.

Leveraging the `datadogpy` package on PyPI ([https://pypi.org/project/datadog/](https://pypi.org/project/datadog/)), which is the official DataDog API client for Python.  Create a CI/CD pipeline (like GitHub Actions) to deploy the DataDog dashboards.  It aligns perfectly with the concept of automating dashboard creation.

## Project Structure

```bash
datadog-dashboard-deployer/
├── src/
│   └── datadog_dashboard_deployer/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── core.py       # Core logic for dashboard creation
│       ├── config.py     # Configuration handling
│       └── utils.py      # Utility functions
├── config/
│   └── dashboard_config.yaml  # Main dashboard configuration
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── setup.py
```

## Key Components

1.  **`src/datadog_dashboard_deployer/core.py`:** This would contain the core logic for interacting with the DataDog API using `datadogpy`.  It would handle:
    *   Reading the dashboard configuration from `config/dashboard_config.yaml`.
    *   Authenticating with DataDog using API and APP keys.
    *   Creating, updating, or deleting dashboards based on the configuration.

2.  **`src/datadog_dashboard_deployer/config.py`:**  Handles parsing and validating the `dashboard_config.yaml` file.  It would define the expected schema for the configuration.

3.  **`config/dashboard_config.yaml`:** This is the main configuration file where users define their dashboards.  It would include:
    *   Dashboard titles and descriptions.
    *   Widget definitions (metric queries, graph types, etc.).
    *   Layout information.
    *   Placeholders for dynamic data (if needed).

4.  **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:** The GitHub Actions workflow file.  This would:
    *   Be triggered manually or on a schedule.
    *   Install the necessary dependencies (`datadogpy`, potentially others).
    *   Set the DataDog API and APP keys as environment variables using GitHub Secrets ( `DATA_DOG_API_KEY` and `DATA_DOG_APP_KEY`).
    *   Run the `datadog-dashboard-deployer` package to deploy the dashboards.

5.  **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the project's dependencies.

6.  **`setup.py`:** Used for packaging the project.

## Workflow

1.  Users fork the repository.
2.  They customize the `config/dashboard_config.yaml` file to define their dashboards.
3.  They add their DataDog API and APP keys as secrets in their forked repository's settings on GitHub.
4.  They can either manually trigger the `deploy.yml` workflow or set it up to run on a schedule.
5.  The workflow will install the dependencies, retrieve the DataDog credentials from the secrets, and execute the `datadog-dashboard-deployer` package.
6.  The package will then create or update the dashboards in the user's DataDog account based on the configuration.

## Advantages

*   **Automation:**  Dashboards are deployed automatically, reducing manual effort.
*   **Version Control:**  Dashboard configurations are stored in Git, allowing for versioning and collaboration.
*   **Reproducibility:**  The deployment process is consistent and repeatable.
*   **Security:**  API keys are stored securely as GitHub secrets, not directly in the code.
*   **Easy to Use:**  Users only need to configure the YAML file and set up the secrets.

### Key Improvements and Considerations

*   **Templating:** Incorporate a templating engine (like Jinja2) to allow for more dynamic dashboard generation based on external data or parameters.
*   **Modularization:**  Design the `core.py` module to be easily extensible, allowing users to add custom dashboard elements or data sources.
*   **Testing:** Implement thorough testing, including unit tests for the Python code and integration tests to verify the DataDog API interaction.  Mocking the DataDog API will be very helpful here.
*   **Error Handling:**  Provide robust error handling and informative error messages.
*   **Documentation:**  Create comprehensive documentation, including a detailed explanation of the `dashboard_config.yaml` structure, instructions for setting up the GitHub Actions workflow, and troubleshooting tips.
